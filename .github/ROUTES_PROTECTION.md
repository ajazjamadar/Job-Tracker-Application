# Routes Protection Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### app/routes.py - Converted to Blueprint with Login Protection

**Blueprint Created:**
- `main_bp` - Main application blueprint for public and protected routes

**Protected Routes (require login):**
1. `/dashboard` - User's dashboard showing their applications
2. `/applications` - List all user's applications
3. `/applications/new` - Create new application
4. `/applications/<id>/edit` - Edit existing application
5. `/applications/<id>/delete` - Delete application (NEW)

**Public Routes:**
- `/` - Landing page (index)
- `/hello` - Test route

**Key Features Added:**
- ✅ `@login_required` decorator on all protected routes
- ✅ `current_user.id` to filter applications by logged-in user
- ✅ User isolation - users only see their own applications
- ✅ 404 handling for unauthorized access attempts
- ✅ Flash messages for user feedback
- ✅ Form-based input with ApplicationForm (replaces raw request.form)
- ✅ Delete application functionality
- ✅ Proper form validation with WTForms

**Security Improvements:**
- Users can only view/edit/delete their own applications
- `.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id)` ensures data isolation
- `.first_or_404()` prevents information leakage

## Registered Blueprints

1. **auth** - Authentication routes (/auth/*)
2. **main** - Main application routes (/, /dashboard, /applications/*)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create/update templates to use new form objects
- [ ] Add pagination to applications list
- [ ] Add filters/search functionality
- [ ] Test complete user flow (register → login → create app → edit → delete)
